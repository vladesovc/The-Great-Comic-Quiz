# The-Great-Comic-Quiz

- Create file/folder structure
    - Two seperate HTML pages (one for the quiz, one for hiscores)
- Once a start button is clicked
    - Quiz starts, timer starts counting down (Set Interval)

    - When an answer is selected
        - IF an answer is wrong, then decrement our timer (15 seconds)
            - Display that user choice was incorrect, move to the next question
        - IF an answer is correct
            - Display that user choice was correct
            - We want to either display score with remaining time OR increment score(Up to you)
        - For loop to loop thru questions array to the next question

    - When timer hits 0 OR no more questions in our array
        - Then we have to clear Interval
        - Then allow user to input initials (prevent default on our html form)
        - Display the users score and Then link to hiscores page
        - Save data to local storage

    - We will use javascript to dynamically create our HTML 
        - createElement to create 
            - Maybe H1 for our question, buttons for our choices, maybe an H2 to display wrong/right to user
